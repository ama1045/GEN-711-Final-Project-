# GEN-711-Final-Project-

This project aims to analyze how the most common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with sickle cell anemia, rs344, on chromosome 11 at base pair 5227002 compares between a subset of randomly selected individuals of African descent (individuals of African ancestry in Southwest US) and a subset of randomly selected individuals NOT of African descent but rather of European ancestry (the British Population in England and Scotland). To do this, exome reads gathered from both populations are BLASTed against the human HBB reference gene, and the hit sequences are used to generate a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT that can be viewed in MView, a multiple alignment viewer. 

Note that it was not possible to carry out the latter portion of this project due to the extensive amount of hits that were generated from the BLAST search and the number of obstacles that were faced throughout the entirety of this project.
